# Evaluate News with Natural Language processing

This project uses the Aylien API to evaluate the sentiment of a given text with natural language processing methods.
One pass some custom text or a url, and it will output the polarity (good or bad mood) and the subjectivity of the text.
There are two modes, `tweet` for shorter text and `document` for longer text.
It also demonstrates the use of webpack, a static bundler and build tool, with various plugins like Babel, Sass and Workbox.
